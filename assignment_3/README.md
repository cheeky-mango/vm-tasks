# Assignment 3

Write a function in ` bc ` (basic calculator) to print the ` n `th Fibonacci number in the Fibonacci series. Write your code and save it within file ` script.sh `.

Hint : use `echo` and `bc`

## Optional : 

You can also try the function using bash loops.


## Example :

Fibonacci sequence : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, .....

Sample execution and output : 
```
~/se2001/assignment_3$ ./script.sh 5
3
```

` 3 ` is at the ` 5 `th position in the Fibonacci sequence.
